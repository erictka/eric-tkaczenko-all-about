  <h2> Eric as a <em>Programmer</em></h2>
   <p> He was the leader of an important project at the massive industrial-technological institution SENAI in Brazil in the field of <br> industrial technology development, consulting, and provision of services to companies. </p>
      <p> At just 17 years old, he was chosen through votes among the leaders of the department at his unit 
        (among the students of digital game development) <br> to lead the project, which aimed to create a platform consisting of modules. 
        This platform would allow industrial workers to enhance their job skills or even learn various new ways of performing their tasks.<br>
         It would also instruct them on how to use safety equipment (PPE) effectively and follow life protection norms
          (the same would apply to newly hired company operators).</p>
          <p>This platform would achieve these goals through a variety of games, divided into modules, with the objective of teaching the worker in <br>
             the most interactive, intuitive, and enjoyable manner possible.
          </p>

<p>
    The project continues within SENAI, being developed based on Eric's ideas. <br> 
    He left the project upon completing his technical studies to focus on improving other areas of his life, 
     leaving the SENAI team in charge of developing the concept, including two games with their two prototype modules and the <br>
     development of level design for future scenarios/games.

    <h2> Eric as a <em>Digital Marketing</em> </h2>  
    <p> Eric, while at SENAI, not only discovered himself in the programming field but also found his passion in design and HTML, <br>
         as well as JavaScript and CSS. This led him, after completing his technical education,<br>
          to utilize his newly acquired skills in the job market. <br>
          As a freelancer, using the skills from his technical education, he managed to launch several websites and create various logos, banners, and social media management. <br>
