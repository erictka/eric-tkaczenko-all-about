  <h2> Eric as a <em>Programmer</em></h2>
   <p> He was the leader of an important project at the massive industrial-technological institution SENAI in Brazil in the field of <br> industrial technology development, consulting, and provision of services to companies. </p>
      <p> At just 17 years old, he was chosen through votes among the leaders of the department at his unit 
        (among the students of digital game development) <br> to lead the project, which aimed to create a platform consisting of modules. 
        This platform would allow industrial workers to enhance their job skills or even learn various new ways of performing their tasks.<br>
         It would also instruct them on how to use safety equipment (PPE) effectively and follow life protection norms
          (the same would apply to newly hired company operators).</p>
          <p>This platform would achieve these goals through a variety of games, divided into modules, with the objective of teaching the worker in <br>
             the most interactive, intuitive, and enjoyable manner possible.
          </p>
<p>
    The project continues within SENAI, being developed based on Eric's ideas. <br> 
    He left the project upon completing his technical studies to focus on improving other areas of his life, <br>
     leaving the SENAI team in charge of developing the concept, including two games with their two prototype modules and the <br>
     development of level design for future scenarios/games."
